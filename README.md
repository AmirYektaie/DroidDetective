<br>

DroidDetective is a Python tool for analyzing Android applications (APKs) for potential malware related behavior. This works by training a Random Forest classifier on information derived from both known malware APKs and standard APKs available on the Android app store. This tooling comes pre-trained, however, the model can be re-trained on a new dataset at any time. ‚öôÔ∏è

# ü§ñ Getting Started 
## Installation 
All DroidDetective dependencies can be installed manually or via the requirements file, with 

``` bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

DroidDetective has been tested on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.0 LTS.

## Usage 
DroidDetective can be run by providing the Python file with an APK as a command line parameter, such as:
```
python DroidDetective.py myAndroidApp.apk
```
If an ```apk_malware.model``` file is not present, then the tooling will first train the model and will require a training set of APKs in both a folder at the root of the project called ```malware``` and another called ```normal```. Once run successfully a result will be printed onto the CLI on if the model has identified the APK to be malicious or benign. An example of this output can be seen below:

```
>> Analysed file 'com.android.camera2.apk', identified as not malware.
```

# ‚öóÔ∏è Data Science | The ML Model
This model currently uses permissions from an APKs ```AndroidManifest.xml``` file as a feature set. This works by creating a dictionary of [each standard Android permission](https://gist.github.com/Arinerron/1bcaadc7b1cbeae77de0263f4e15156f) and setting the feature to ```1``` if the permission is present in the APK. Similarly, a feature is added for the amount of permissions in use in the manifest and for the amount of unidentified permissions found in the manifest. 

The pre-trained model was trained off approximately 14 malware families (each with one or more APK files), located from [ashisdb's repository](https://github.com/ashishb/android-malware), and approximately 100 normal applications located from the Google Play Store.

The below denotes the statistics for this ML model:

```
Accuracy: 0.9310344827586207
Recall: 0.9166666666666666
Precision: 0.9166666666666666
F-Measure: 0.9166666666666666
```
